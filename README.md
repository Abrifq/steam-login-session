KNOWN ISSUES
------------

All Versions: You may have issues with multi-monitor setup. Still can't figure out yet a way to fix this, any help is appreciate

Hacked version: After playing a game you will need to press "alt+tab" to return to the steam bigpicture mode. After exiting you will need to press on the steam window on "steam" and after "exit". If you press in the close button the window will only minimize, you may need to press alt+tab again to gain focus and then exit it.

INSTALL
